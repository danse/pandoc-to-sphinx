now we want everything to go into a customisable folder
it was based on the hardcoded parent
so the current logic is broken
i removed the "index/" prefix from getPath

moving to a command is a good idea regardless of the error with dependencies
the logic is not trivial

maybe with an option to copy the media folder
keeping the files if it exists?
creating it if it doesn't exist
we want to put the result in a directory argument

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative-0.14.2.0/docs/Options-Applicative-Builder.html#v:str
not sure about how to specify an optional option

accepting json input

if there is anything from `convert.hs`, i can add it eventually
what happens when pandoc reads an RST which refers to media?

i can add new options after we fix the problem with table wraps in docs2rst
